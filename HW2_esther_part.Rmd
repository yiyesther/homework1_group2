# Challenge 1: Excess rentals in TfL bike sharing

Recall the TfL data on how many bikes were hired every single day. We can get the latest data by running the following

```{r, get_tfl_data, cache=TRUE}
url <- "https://data.london.gov.uk/download/number-bicycle-hires/ac29363e-e0cb-47cc-a97a-e216d900a6b0/tfl-daily-cycle-hires.xlsx"

# Download TFL data to temporary file
httr::GET(url, write_disk(bike.temp <- tempfile(fileext = ".xlsx")))

# Use read_excel to read it as dataframe
bike0 <- read_excel(bike.temp,
                   sheet = "Data",
                   range = cell_cols("A:B"))

# change dates to get year, month, and week
bike <- bike0 %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  rename (bikes_hired = number_of_bicycle_hires) %>% 
  mutate (year = year(day),
          month = lubridate::month(day, label = TRUE),
          week = isoweek(day))
```



We can easily create a facet grid that plots bikes hired by month and year.

```{r tfl_month_year_grid, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "tfl_distributions_monthly.png"), error = FALSE)
```

Look at May and Jun and compare 2020 with the previous years. What's happening?

* According to the above graph, most of the months are of a right skewed distribution while May and June are close to a normal distribution. Being right skewed means that the average bike rental value is smaller than that of which distribution is normal. During summer, it is both predicted that bike rentals go up, and this explains the observation for May and June in this graph. It can also be seen that for the lower hire counts, their frequencies are very low. This indicates that bike rental was so popular that the very few low hire counts were observed.

* For year 2020, the pandemic obviously had heavily struck the bike rental industry. Overall, the frequency of renting a bike has decreased significantly compared to the other years. However, it is interesting to find that for the lower hire counts in May and June, their frequency increased in 2020 with regard to previous years. As it gets less popular for people to go out and rent bikes, the lower hire counts would appear more frequently than before. In fact, all the plots for 2020 are more right skewed than they were in the other years, as the data set shifted to lower hire counts due to the pandemic.


However, the challenge I want you to work on is to reproduce the following two graphs.

```{r tfl_absolute_monthly_change, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "tfl_monthly.png"), error = FALSE)
```

The second one looks at percentage changes from the expected level of weekly rentals. The two grey shaded rectangles correspond to Q2 (weeks 14-26) and Q4 (weeks 40-52).

```{r tfl_percent_change, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "tfl_weekly.png"), error = FALSE)
```

For both of these graphs, you have to calculate the expected number of rentals per week or month between 2016-2019 and then, see how each week/month of 2020-2021 compares to the expected rentals. Think of the calculation `excess_rentals = actual_rentals - expected_rentals`. 

Should you use the mean or the median to calculate your expected rentals? Why?

First, we take a glimpse of the dataset.
```{r}
glimpse(bike)
```

Then we look at the data if there's missing values.
```{r}
skim(bike)
#We can see that there are no missing values. 
```


```{r}
#Prepare the dataframe for the first graph (monthly bike rental)
bike$day = as.Date(bike$day)

#filter the data for 2016-2019
history_bike <- bike %>% 
  filter(between(day, as.Date("2016-01-01"), as.Date("2019-12-30")))

#calculate the overall monthly average between 2016-2019 as benchmark
expected_bike_pcm <- history_bike %>% 
  group_by(month) %>% 
  summarise(expected_rental = mean(bikes_hired))

#calculate the excess rentals and percentage for 2016-2021
#excess_rentals = actual_rentals - expected_rentals
actual_bike_pcm <- bike %>% 
  filter(between(day, as.Date("2016-01-01"), as.Date("2021-12-30"))) %>% 
  group_by(year,month) %>% 
  summarise(actual_rental = mean(bikes_hired)) %>% 
  left_join(expected_bike_pcm, by = "month") %>% 
  mutate(excess_rentals = actual_rental - expected_rental)
```


```{r}
#Prepare the dataframe for the second graph (weekly bike rental)

#calculate the overall weekly average between 2016-2019 as benchmark
expected_bike_pw <- history_bike %>% 
  group_by(week) %>% 
  summarise(expected_rentals = mean(bikes_hired))

#calculate the excess rentals and percentage for 2016-2021
actual_bike_pw <- bike %>% 
  filter(between(day, as.Date("2016-01-01"), as.Date("2021-12-30"))) %>% 
  group_by(year,week) %>% 
  summarise(actual_rental = mean(bikes_hired)) %>% 
  left_join(expected_bike_pw, by = "week") %>% 
  mutate(excess_rentals = actual_rental - expected_rentals, 
         excess_rentals_pct = excess_rentals/expected_rentals) 

```

# Rubric

Check minus (1/5): Displays minimal effort. Doesn't complete all components. Code is poorly written and not documented. Uses the same type of plot for each graph, or doesn't use plots appropriate for the variables being analyzed. 

Check (3/5): Solid effort. Hits all the elements. No clear mistakes. Easy to follow (both the code and the output). 

Check plus (5/5): Finished all components of the assignment correctly and addressed both challenges. Code is well-documented (both self-documented and with additional comments as necessary). Used tidyverse, instead of base R. Graphs and tables are properly labelled. Analysis is clear and easy to follow, either because graphs are labeled clearly or you've written additional text to describe how you interpret the output.
